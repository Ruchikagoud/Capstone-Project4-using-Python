This repository contains a data analysis and visualization project combining Python for data preprocessing and Power BI for interactive dashboards. The goal is to analyze project cost, employee data, and sales performance, extracting insights to aid decision-making.

Key Objectives
Data Preprocessing with Python
-Create structured datasets for analysis.
-Handle missing values using a running average method.

Data Preprocessing (Python)
-Created structured DataFrames for:
-Project details (cost, status, and ID mapping).
-Employee information (name, gender, location, and age).
-Seniority levels (designation levels for employees).
-Handled missing values in project costs using a running average.
-Exported cleaned datasets as CSV files for analysis.
