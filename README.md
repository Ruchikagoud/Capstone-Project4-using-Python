This repository contains a Python-based capstone project designed to demonstrate data analysis, machine learning, or automation skills. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and covers various stages of data processing, analysis, and visualization.

Purpose
The purpose of this capstone project is to:
-Apply Python programming skills to solve a real-world problem.
-Use data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
-Implement machine learning models (if applicable).
-Automate processes or generate insights from a dataset.

What Has Been Done
-Data Collection: Loaded and preprocessed data from a given dataset.
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
-Data cleaning and handling missing values.
-Visualization of trends and patterns.
-Feature Engineering: Creating new features for better analysis.
-Evaluated model performance using various metrics.
Final Insights & Conclusions: Summarized key findings and recommendations.
Data Collection: Loaded and preprocessed data from a given dataset.
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Key Objectives
Data Preprocessing with Python
-Create structured datasets for analysis.
-Handle missing values using a running average method.

Data Preprocessing (Python)
-Created structured DataFrames for:
-Project details (cost, status, and ID mapping).
-Employee information (name, gender, location, and age).
-Seniority levels (designation levels for employees).
-Handled missing values in project costs using a running average.
-Exported cleaned datasets as CSV files for analysis.

Results
By completing this capstone project, 
-Gained hands-on experience with Python for data analysis.
-Developed a structured approach to solving data-driven problems.
-Understood how to preprocess, visualize, and interpret data.
